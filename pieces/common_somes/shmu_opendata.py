"""Client for the SHMU open data server (Slovak Hydrometeorological Institute).

https://opendata.shmu.sk — free, no registration, CC-BY 4.0.

Why this exists: Open-Meteo is a reanalysis/model product and its irradiance is
biased against ground measurement, by a location-dependent amount. Measured
against SHMU pyranometers over five days at six Slovak sites the bias ranged
from -12.9% (Bratislava) to +3.3% (Kosice), mean -6.1%. For an investment case
that error propagates straight into yield, payback and sizing, so the workflow
needs a measured reference to correct against.

What the server offers that matters here: the automatic weather station feed
``meteorology/climate/now`` carries ``zglo``, global solar radiation in W/m2, as
a one-minute average, for 44 stations across Slovakia, published every five
minutes. The catch is that this directory is a rolling window of roughly 30 days
— there is no deep sub-hourly archive — so it is a calibration source, not a
substitute for the historical weather series.
